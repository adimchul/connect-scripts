# Move files pack

This folder contains set of scripts which will clean up the source folder after files were delivered to destination. These scripts can only be used with transfer jobs (distribution and consolidation). The contents of the files below should be copied inside triggers of your transfer jobs. The "copy_to_complete..." script can be modified to do a particular action with the files on destination peer, if necessary. By default it does not do anything with files on destination peer.
